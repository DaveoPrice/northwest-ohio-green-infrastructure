# Regional Green Infrastructure Network (RGIN) Web Map Architecture

## Overview

The Regional Green Infrastructure Network (RGIN) web map application is designed to support green infrastructure planning and public engagement across Wood, Lucas, and Ottawa Counties in Ohio. This document outlines the architecture of the application, including its components, data flow, and design decisions.

## Architecture Components

The application follows a client-side architecture with the following components:

### 1. User Interface Components

- **Map Container**: The central map display using Leaflet.js
- **Sidebar**: Contains layer controls, filters, and legend
- **Feature Info Panel**: Displays detailed information about selected features
- **Analysis Panel**: Interface for buffer and intersection analysis tools
- **Search Interface**: Search bar and results display

### 2. Core Modules

- **Map Module** (`map.js`): Handles map initialization, basemaps, and controls
- **Data Module** (`data.js`): Manages data loading, processing, and filtering
- **Layers Module** (`layers.js`): Controls layer creation, styling, and interaction
- **Search Module** (`search.js`): Implements search functionality and results display
- **Filters Module** (`filters.js`): Manages filtering by county, type, and status
- **Analysis Module** (`analysis.js`): Implements buffer and intersection analysis tools
- **Application Module** (`app.js`): Coordinates initialization and component interaction

### 3. Configuration

- **Configuration Module** (`config.js`): Contains application settings, map parameters, and styling options

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization Flow**:
   - Application loads and initializes the map
   - Data is loaded from GeoJSON files
   - Layers are created and added to the map
   - UI components are initialized and connected

2. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - User toggles layers → Layer visibility is updated
   - User searches → Data is filtered and results displayed
   - User applies filters → Layers are updated with filtered data
   - User selects a feature → Feature details are displayed
   - User performs analysis → Analysis is executed and results displayed

## Design Decisions

### Client-Side Architecture

The application uses a client-side architecture with static files hosted on GitHub Pages. This approach was chosen for:

- **Zero hosting costs**: No server infrastructure required
- **Simplicity**: Easier deployment and maintenance
- **Performance**: Fast loading and response times for basic operations
- **Accessibility**: Works well on various devices and connection speeds

### Leaflet as Mapping Library

Leaflet.js was selected as the mapping library for:

- **Lightweight**: Small file size for faster loading
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works well on mobile devices
- **Extensibility**: Rich ecosystem of plugins
- **Open source**: Free to use and modify

### GeoJSON for Data Storage

GeoJSON was chosen as the data format for:

- **Standardization**: Well-established format for geospatial data
- **Simplicity**: Easy to read, write, and modify
- **Browser compatibility**: Native support in modern browsers
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Leaflet and Turf.js

### Turf.js for Spatial Analysis

Turf.js was selected for client-side spatial analysis:

- **Client-side processing**: No server required for analysis
- **Comprehensive**: Supports buffer, intersection, and other spatial operations
- **Performance**: Optimized for browser environments
- **Integration**: Works well with GeoJSON and Leaflet

### Modular Code Structure

The application uses a modular code structure with:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and extend
- **Readability**: Clear organization makes code easier to understand
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other projects

## Responsive Design

The application implements responsive design for:

- **Mobile compatibility**: Works on smartphones and tablets
- **Adaptive layout**: UI adjusts based on screen size
- **Touch-friendly controls**: Optimized for touch interaction
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient rendering on mobile devices

## Limitations and Constraints

- **Data size**: Limited by client-side processing and browser memory
- **Analysis complexity**: Complex spatial operations may be slower than server-side processing
- **Offline functionality**: Limited without additional implementation
- **User authentication**: Not implemented for editing capabilities

## Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future extensions such as:

- **Additional data layers**: New infrastructure types can be added
- **Enhanced analysis tools**: More complex spatial analysis
- **Offline support**: Using browser storage for offline access
- **User accounts**: Could be added with external authentication services
- **Data editing**: Could be implemented with GitHub API integration

## Conclusion

The RGIN web map application architecture provides a solid foundation for a free, accessible, and feature-rich mapping tool for green infrastructure planning. The client-side approach with static hosting on GitHub Pages ensures zero hosting costs while delivering core functionality for visualization, search, filtering, and basic spatial analysis.
